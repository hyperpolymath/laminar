Welcome to the Laminar documentation wiki. This comprehensive guide covers everything from basic usage to advanced development.

== What is Laminar?

Laminar is a **high-velocity cloud-to-cloud streaming relay** that transfers data between cloud storage providers (Dropbox, Google Drive, S3, Azure, OneDrive, and 40+ others) without downloading files to local persistent storage.

=== Key Benefits

* **Zero Local Storage**: Data flows through RAM, never persists to disk
* **Maximum Speed**: Parallel streams saturate your network bandwidth
* **Intelligent**: Automatically compresses, converts, or skips files based on content
* **Secure**: TLS everywhere, no data logging, ephemeral containers
* **Universal**: Works with any Rclone-supported cloud provider
